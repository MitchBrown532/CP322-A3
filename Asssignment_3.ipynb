        " This is a **group (of 2)** assignment, and we will practice the concepts to build classification and regression models etc. There are two parts to this assingment.\n",
        " \n",
        " For this assignment, you must use Python language. You will use this jupyter notebook to write your code without errors. If your code will not run, then you will score zero. Therefore, ensure you have removed all syntax errors from your code and not changing the variable names. Gradescope platform would be used to upload the assignments for grading and autograded question's feedback will be visible to you. The link to the Gradescope assignment is available on Myls course page. \n",
        " \n",
        " For submission, drag and drop your code file(s) into Gradescope and add your partner's name. Make sure that your file name should be as suggested in the assignment, using a different name may score zero.\n",
        " \n",
        " - Please note that the submitted code will be checked for plagiarism. By submitting this zip file, you would confirm that you have not received unauthorized assistance in preparing the assignment. You also confirm that you are aware of course policies for submitted work. \n",
        " \n",
        " - Marks will be deducted from any questions where these requirements are not met.\n",
        " \n",
        " - Multiple attempts will be allowed, and only your last submission before the deadline will be graded. Instructor reserves the right to take off points for not following the directions.\n",
        " \n",
        "<b>Warning:</b> Follow the assignment instructions to the letter in terms of the variable names and function names, as this assignment will be auto-graded except few written type questions. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Points**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For each question in the assignment, please write down your answer in the answer cell(s) right below the question. \n",
        "- It is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run codes, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when autograder run.\n",
        "- Finally, unless it is stated otherwise, try to avoid using python for loops or list comprehensions.  The majority of this part of assignment can be done using builtin commands in Pandas, numpy, searborn, matplotlib, and sklearn functions.  \n",
        "- **Partners.** You may work with one other partner; **Only one person is required to submit to the assignment. On Gradescope, the person who submits *must* also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. Make sure to **re-add your partner every time you make a new submission**, as Gradescope does not save partner information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tests.** The tests that are given are **not comprehensive** and passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work! You might want to create your own checks along the way to see if your answers make sense. Additionally, before you submit, make sure that none of your cells take a very long time to run (several minutes). Always it is good to re-run your assignment cells before submission. \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Free Response/written Questions.** Make sure that you put the answers to the written questions in the indicated cell we provide. **Every free response question should include an explanation** that adequately answers the question. The written questions will be manually graded on Gradescope.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated task, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. \n",
        "\n",
        "To get started, load the required packages. Make sure to also run the first cell of this notebook to load `otter`."

The test dataset will help us determine the accuracy of our predictions by comparing the actual genres of the movies with the genres that our classifier predicts. Therefore, we must ensure that there are no movies that appear in both sets. We do so by splitting the dataset randomly. The dataset has already been permuted randomly, so it's easy to split.

        "We are going to `simulate` the steps that `K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)` algorithm will use for classification, i.e.,  Given some numerical *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides which category that example belongs to based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*.\n",
        "\n",
        "An attribute (feature) we have about each movie is *the proportion of times a particular word appears in the movie*, and the labels are two movie genres: comedy and thriller.  The algorithm requires many previously seen examples for which both the attributes and labels are known: that's the `train_movies` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build understanding, we're going to visualize the algorithm instead of just describing it."

        "\n",
        "In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"water\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (in the test set), 0.000804074 of its words are \"water\" and 0.0010721 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features on a scatter diagram. \n",
        "\n",
        "**This distance is called the Euclidean (\"yoo-KLID-ee-un\") distance, whose formula is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in the movie *Clerks.* (in the training set), 0.00016293 of all the words in the movie are \"water\" and 0.00154786 are \"feel\".  Its distance from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000804074 - 0.000162933)^2 + (0.0010721 - 0.00154786)^2} \\approx 0.000798379$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n",
        "\n",
        "A third movie, *The Godfather* (in the training set), has 0 \"water\" and 0.00015122 \"feel\". \n",
        "\n",
        "The function below creates a plot to display the \"water\" and \"feel\" features of a test movie and some training movies. As you can see in the result, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is more similar to *Clerks.* than to the *The Godfather* based on these features, which makes sense as both movies are comedy movies, while *The Godfather* is a thriller."
